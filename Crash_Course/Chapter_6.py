Consider a game featuring aliens that can have different colors and point
values. This simple dictionary stores information about a particular alien:
alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}
print(alien_0['color'])
print(alien_0['points'])
The dictionary alien_0 stores the alien’s color and point value. The last
two lines access and display that information, as shown here:
green
5
As with most new programming concepts, using dictionaries takes
practice. Once you’ve worked with dictionaries for a bit you’ll soon see how
effectively they can model real-world situations.
Working with Dictionaries
A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is connected
to a value, and you can use a key to access the value associated with that key.
A key’s value can be a number, a string, a list, or even another dictionary.
In fact, you can use any object that you can create in Python as a value in a
dictionary.
In Python, a dictionary is wrapped in braces, {}, with a series of keyvalue
pairs inside the braces, as shown in the earlier example:
alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}
A key-value pair is a set of values associated with each other. When you
provide a key, Python returns the value associated with that key. Every key
is connected to its value by a colon, and individual key-value pairs are separated
by commas. You can store as many key-value pairs as you want in a
dictionary.
The simplest dictionary has exactly one key-value pair, as shown in this
modified version of the alien_0 dictionary:
alien_0 = {'color': 'green'}
alien.py

then place the key inside a set of square brackets, as shown here:
alien_0 = {'color': 'green'}
print(alien_0['color'])
This returns the value associated with the key 'color' from the dictionary
alien_0:
green
You can have an unlimited number of key-value pairs in a dictionary.
For example, here’s the original alien_0 dictionary with two key-value pairs:
alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}
Now you can access either the color or the point value of alien_0. If a
player shoots down this alien, you can look up how many points they should
earn using code like this:
alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}
u new_points = alien_0['points']
v print(f"You just earned {new_points} points!")
Once the dictionary has been defined, the code at u pulls the value
associated with the key 'pointsthen place the key inside a set of square brackets, as shown here:
alien_0 = {'color': 'green'}
print(alien_0['color'])
This returns the value associated with the key 'color' from the dictionary
alien_0:
green
You can have an unlimited number of key-value pairs in a dictionary.
For example, here’s the original alien_0 dictionary with two key-value pairs:

earn using code like this:
alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}
u new_points = alien_0['points']
v print(f"You just earned {new_points} points!")
Once the dictionary has been defined, the code at u pulls the value
associated with the key 'pointsthen place the key inside a set of square brackets, as shown here:
alien_0 = {'color': 'green'}
print(alien_0['color'])
This returns the value associated with the key 'color' from the dictionary
